# ðŸš€ GSLV MkIII Launch Simulation  

This repository contains a **MATLAB-based simulation of GSLV MkIII (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle â€“ Mark III)**, Indiaâ€™s heaviest rocket developed by **ISRO**.  
The project models the **three main stages of launch**, from liftoff to final orbital injection, using simplified physics-based equations of motion.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  

- **Stage 1 â€“ S200 Boosters**  
  Simulates liftoff using twin solid rocket boosters, including thrust, drag, gravity effects, and gravity turn initiation.  

- **Stage 2 â€“ L110 Liquid Core (Vikas Engines)**  
  Models ascent after booster separation with twin Vikas engines, considering drag, gravity losses, and mass depletion.  

- **Stage 3 â€“ CE-20 Cryogenic Upper Stage**  
  Simulates orbital injection using cryogenic propulsion, including cutoff conditions (target velocity & altitude) and a simple pitch program.  

Each stage outputs **altitude, velocity, downrange trajectory, and final stage conditions**, with plots for visualization.  

---

## ðŸ”§ Features  

- Stage-wise modular MATLAB scripts.  
- Simplified **atmosphere (ISA + exponential)** and **gravity models**.  
- Plots for:  
  - Altitude vs. Time  
  - Velocity vs. Time  
  - Trajectory (Downrange vs. Altitude)  
- Final stage outputs: altitude, velocity, flight angle, and mass.

## ðŸ“Š Example Outputs  

Each stage produces plots like:

-![Stage 2](images/Stage_2.png)
-![Stage 3](images/Stage_3.png)

## ðŸ“š Applications  

This project is useful for:  

- Understanding **multi-stage rocket dynamics**.  
- Studying the **effects of thrust, drag, and gravity** on launch trajectories.  
- Providing a **starting point for trajectory optimization research**.  

## ðŸš€ Future Work  

- Adding **staging animations** for better visualization.  
- Extending to **full orbital propagation** (e.g., GTO insertion).  
- Implementing **real ISRO launch data comparisons**.  
- Expanding to simulate **other launch vehicles**.
